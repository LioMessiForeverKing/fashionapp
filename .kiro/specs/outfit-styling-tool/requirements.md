# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Closet Fairy is a personal fashion assistant mobile app that transforms the daily struggle of "what to wear" into an empowering tool for self-expression and confidence. The app helps users discover and create outfits by intelligently combining their existing wardrobe with curated style inspiration and strategic shopping recommendations. 

The core problem Closet Fairy solves is the common scenario where users have clothing items (like a long black skirt) but struggle to style them confidently. Instead of endlessly scrolling Pinterest and trying to mentally match inspiration photos with their actual wardrobe, Closet Fairy streamlines this process by analyzing the user's real clothing inventory and providing personalized styling suggestions.

The app's primary value proposition is maximizing the potential of existing wardrobes while building user confidence through personalized styling guidance. Rather than encouraging constant shopping, Closet Fairy focuses on creative styling of owned pieces, with strategic shopping suggestions only when gaps are identified. The app serves as a digital styling assistant that understands both the user's personal style preferences and their actual clothing inventory.
